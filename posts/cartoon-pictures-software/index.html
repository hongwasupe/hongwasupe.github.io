-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=computer-software-cartoons-by-marty-bucella-3>Computer Software Cartoons By Marty Bucella<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#computer-software-cartoons-by-marty-bucella-3>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://www.martybucella.com/C3.gif onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.-MvbrC38lzmaqJGJKYkdRQAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Computer Software Cartoons by Marty Bucella"><p><em>Source: martybucella.com</em></p><blockquote><p>software computer cartoons marty bucella.</p></blockquote><p>Anime wallpaper is a popular way to add some extra excitement to your home screen.
