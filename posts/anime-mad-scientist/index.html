-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=kokan-nejire---mad-scientist-of-12th-division-by-vlandorn-on-deviantart>Kokan, Nejire - Mad Scientist Of 12th Division By Vlandorn On DeviantArt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#kokan-nejire---mad-scientist-of-12th-division-by-vlandorn-on-deviantart>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://pre00.deviantart.net/8828/th/pre/i/2012/216/0/b/kokan__nejire___mad_scientist_of_12th_division_by_vlandorn-d56ajbv.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.AvPilRGrRevMgYomATHZ_QHaKp&pid=15.1"' alt="Kokan, Nejire - Mad Scientist of 12th Division by Vlandorn on DeviantArt"><p><em>Source: deviantart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>scientist mad deviantart kokan nejire commission 12th division.</p></blockquote><p>The History of Anime: From Manga to Animation
