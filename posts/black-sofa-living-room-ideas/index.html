While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://hongwasupe.github.io/tags/best-wallpaper/>Best Wallpaper</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://hongwasupe.github.io/posts/black-and-white-tiger-sketch/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Black And White Tiger Sketch : Tiger Face Drawing By Jerry Winick</span></a>
