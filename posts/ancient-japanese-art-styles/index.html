While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=samurai-with-naginata-canvas-art-by-unknown-artist--icanvas>Samurai With Naginata Canvas Art By Unknown Artist | ICanvas<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#samurai-with-naginata-canvas-art-by-unknown-artist--icanvas>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/31/10/8a/31108a4c444a394d4494afe4391565b2.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.FTxIBYsmnNcVUyh8R0_GLAHaLH&pid=15.1"' alt="Samurai with Naginata Canvas Art by Unknown Artist | iCanvas"><p><em>Source: pinterest.ca</em></p><blockquote><p>naginata traditional woodcut woodblock icanvas japones japanische tradicional japonesa grabado samourai feudal ukiyo giapponese 1614 japonesas edo armaduras 錦絵.</p></blockquote><p>The History of Anime: From Manga to Animation
